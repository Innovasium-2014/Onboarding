# Onboarding

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Alumni Section

At the bottom of this document there is a list of student names who have worked
at Innovasium either during the summer or for their coop/internship program. If
you are a new student, feel free to add your name and submit a pull request!

## Example Components

This repo hosts a collection of components that serve to expedite the onboarding
process of learning React. They are contrived examples, as we would like you to learn
the fundamentals fast and use the core concepts of React outside the scope of a
large production application.

Inside the `src/components` folder you will find a selection of folders that act
as placeholders to build out these examples. In each folder there is a markdown
document that shows a reference to the original idea and the functionality we ask
you to build.

It is recommended that you implement the given functionality before worrying about
how nice the component looks. Worry about styling afterwards if you so desire. If
you're feeling extra ambitious, try tackling the bonus functionality section of
each component.
