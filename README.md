## React App Tutorial Links

Here are some useful resources for getting up and running with frontend React development.

1. [Javascript Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Essential-Training/81266-2.html?srchtrk=index:1%0Alinktypeid:2%0Aq:javascript%2Bessential%2Btraining%0Apage:1%0As:relevance%0Asa:true%0Aproducttypeid:2) from Lynda.com. This is a great intro to Javascript as a language, and the DOM API.
2. [React Official Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html): this takes you through building a comment system in plain old React, without a build system. Download the zip file, cd into the folder and run ```
npm install
npm start
``` and open [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) to run the app. Try your best to type out the code yourself instead of just copy-pasting it.
3. [Essential ES6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CozSF5abcTA): this video will introduce you to some new Javascript language features we are using in our apps.
4. [Getting Started With Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux): this course introduces you to Redux, a library we use to handle state management in our frontend single-page apps.
