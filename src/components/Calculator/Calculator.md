# Calculator

Example idea came from here - [React Practice Problems](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/)

In this example you will be building a calculator interface. Please note that the objective is
not to build the functionality of calculating the user's input, but simply implementing
the interface features outlined below. Reference the original idea website above
for how you may lay out your interface.

## Functionality

- Display for numbers from 0 - 9 keys
- Display for +, -, /, \* and = operation keys
- Display for current calculation
- Display for clear all button
- Allow the user to click the buttons above and construct a calculation
- Calculate the operations typed once = is pressed using Javascript `eval()` (note this is not best practice, just something to quickly prototype the interface)

### Bonus Functionality

Please complete all functionality above before implementing the following.

- Allow the user to click into the generated operations and add/remove entries in place
- Allow the user to enter operations by typing on their keyboard, and only allow the options listed above
